# Quirin 13

Quirin is a horse. More specifically, he is a sport-oriented bred horse of the breeding area "Holsteiner". Although he was mainly bred for show jumping, he now enjoys his life as a leisure horse. He was born in April 2004, so he is now 16 years old. He is mainly healthy; however, occasionally suffers from a cough and lung problems. He can be a little diva sometimes but is mainly very friendly and cooperative. You just shouldn't push him too much as he doesn't like too much pressure.
